1. You need to have OCaml and a couple of auxilliary packages installed.
   On a debian-based system you can write:

     sudo apt-get install ocaml-findlib libounit-ocaml-dev libxml-light-ocaml-dev 

   Otherwise you need to manually install 
     * OCaml (http://caml.inria.fr)
     * XML-light (http://tech.motion-twin.com/xmllight.html)
     * findlibs (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html)

2. Build Cil and Goblint by executing the usual configure/make commands.
   If all dependencies are installed, you can just run the script:

     ./build_all.sh

3. Try if it works for you.

     cd analyzer 
     ./goblint tests/regression/04-mutex/01-simple_rc.c
